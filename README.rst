Duck theme for Pelican
======================

:author: Daniel Greenfeld

This is a fork of the native Pelican `notsosimple` theme, with the addition of a Pygments theme based off the one provided by http://readthedocs.org.

This is designed to work in Pelican 2.x. I have no idea how it will work in Pelican 3.x.
